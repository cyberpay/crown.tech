                        <h4>Stage 1 - A third problem</h4>
                        <p>Currently, the vast majority of blockchain projects are secured by either Proof of Work or Proof of Stake. The Crown team do not believe that these two methods are the future of Blockchain. <strong>We have a third way.</strong></p>

                        <h4>Stage 2 - What problems?</h4>
                        <p>Block size constraints and transaction volume limits are problems for existing conventional blockchain technologies. Stage 2 will consist of the implementation of an elegant system based on Chaositec’s work.</p>
                        <p>As part of Stage 2 or as it’s own stage, Crown will provide an API -- allowing developers to deploy services using Crown Atomic.</p>

                        <p>In order to make this a success we need a strong community. Regular, open and honest communications will be an essential component of this ambitious two year programme of work.</p>
                        <p>There will be breakthroughs and setbacks and we need you with us all of the way. We remain indebted to you for your support so far.</p>
