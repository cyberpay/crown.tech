                    <h2>How merged mining works</h2>
                    <p>
                        Before you start mining Crown, it's useful to understand what Crown mining really means. Crown
                        mining is accomplished by running SHA256 double round hash verification processes in order to
                        validate Crown transactions and provide the requisite security for the public ledger of the
                        Crown network. The speed at which you mine Crowns is measured in hashes per second.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The Crown network compensates Crown miners for their effort by releasing Crown to those who
                        contribute the needed computational power. This comes in the form of both newly issued Crowns
                        and from the transaction fees included in the transactions validated when mining Crowns. The
                        more computing power you contribute then the greater your share of the reward.
                    </p>

                    <h4>Step 1 - Get The Best Crown Mining Hardware</h4>
                    <p><mark>How To Start Crown Mining</mark></p>
                    <p>
                        To begin mining Crowns, you'll need to acquire Crown mining hardware. In the early days of Crown,
                        it was possible to mine with your computer CPU or high speed video processor card. Today that's no
                        longer possible. Custom Crown ASIC chips offer performance up to 100x the capability of older
                        systems have come to dominate the Crown mining industry.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Crown mining with anything less will consume more in electricity than you are likely to earn.
                        It's essential to mine Crowns with the best Crown mining hardware built specifically for that
                        purpose. Several companies such as Avalon offer excellent systems built specifically for Crown mining.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Step 2 - Download Free Crown Mining Software</h4>
                    <p>
                        Once you've received your Crown mining hardware, you'll need to download a special program
                        used for Crown mining. There are many programs out there that can be used for Crown mining,
                        but the two most popular are CGminer and BFGminer which are command line programs.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If you prefer the ease of use that comes with a GUI, you might want to try EasyMiner which
                        is a click and go windows/Linux/Android program.
                    </p>

                    <h4>Step 3 - Join a Crown Mining Pool</h4>
                    <p>
                        Once you're ready to mine Crowns then we recommend joining a Crown mining pool. Crown mining
                        pools are groups of Crown miners working together to solve a block and share in its rewards.
                        Without a Crown mining pool, you might mine Crowns for over a year and never earn any Crowns.
                        It's far more convenient to share the work and split the reward with a much larger group of
                        Crown miners. Here are some options:
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        For a fully decentralized pool, we highly recommend p2pool.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The following pools are believed to be currently fully validating blocks with Crown Core 0.9.2.

                    <h4>Step 4 - Set Up A Crown Wallet</h4>
                    <p>
                        The next step to mining Crowns is to set up a Crown wallet or use your existing Crown wallet to
                        receive the Crowns you mine.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Crowns are sent to your Crown wallet by using a unique address that only belongs to you. The
                        most important step in setting up your Crown wallet is securing it from potential threats by
                        enabling two-factor authentication or keeping it on an offline computer that doesn't have
                        access to the Internet. Wallets can be obtained by downloading a software client to your computer.
