				day he noticed that cryptography systems where bundling a variety of different technological solutions into a unified 
				protocol in a way that seemed to have the potential to do a lot of new things. He became involved with the Crown project 
				because the existing members of the team were nice to him and asked good questions in a polite manner, and admitted to what 
				they knew and what they didn't know in a matter of fact way that made sense to him. He watched to many episodes of CHiPs 
				as a child and believes Ready Player One is a work of incandescent genius.</p>
