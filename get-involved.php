                    <h2>Investors</h2>

                    <p>
                        The purpose of an investment portfolio is to produce future returns for a person or organization
                        with current wealth. Investing is about the future.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We believe that in the future, cryptographically secured trustless transaction systems connected to
                        distributed databases will play a key role in the world economy. This technology lowers transaction
                        costs and has the potential to change the structure of transaction costs within every economy.
                        As Ronald Coase noted in his 1937 paper, <strong>the Nature of the Firm</strong>, the structure of transaction costs
                        is a key determinant of the structure of firms in an economy.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As this <strong>innovative combination of technologies</strong>, commonly called blockchain or bitcoin, is applied
                        to existing businesses some will be creative, and others will be creatively destroyed.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Creative destruction is an inevitable result of combinatorial math in an era of technological
                        innovation – the potential combinations of technologies, or new methods, explodes relative to the
                        number of technologies – and because of the effort involved in creating the technologies, the
                        value-added combinations of technologies (or applications) often surprise everyone.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If you have capital available and prefer creativity to being creatively destroyed – and you live in
                        a jurisdiction where investment in Crown is not prohibited, feel free to get in touch with any of
                        the members of the team.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We welcome every kind of diversity, but goal diversity. <strong>Crown’s goal is to be a leading open platform
                        for applications and services which integrate economic processes with the blockchain.</strong>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Much more can be said about the opportunity of investing capital in digital tokens as a store of
                        value. Two parts of an investment hypothesis in digital tokens might be that (1) the prospective
                        returns are asymmetric – you can lose 100%, but if any emerging token successfully becomes useful
                        in the real economy, the potential returns could be well above 100%. (2) the pattern of returns to
                        digital tokens will be distinct from other assets as the underlying technology and uses develop.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>The caveats or warnings are the facts that (1) most digital token or blockchainprojects like
                        Crown will fail, and (2) Crown’s role is not to give investment advice -- we are technologists
                        building an open community and working to build a technology platform for the benefit of that community.</strong>
                    </p>

                        <em>This section is intended as a brief conceptual discussion of how an accredited investor or
                        investment advisor might start to think about where digital tokens fit into a portfolio.</em>

                        Throne Nodes anchor the Crown Network. Throne Nodes are cloud compute instances, which are currently
                        small – but can scale up as the network develops.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        What should we do with this compute capacity? Part of it will be used for processing transactions,
                        but there is so much more that can be done.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The application of cryptography to allow trustless transactions is being integrated more tightly into
                        a variety of processes which combine steps where blockchain trustless technology is useful for a few
                        steps but other steps don’t involve or need a blockchain. Much of the current blockchain hype is about
                        moving things onto the blockchain or owning a business franchise and charging fees for people to get
                        access to blockchain technology. These approaches seem incomplete.

                    <p>
                        Our vision for Crown is to be a leadingopen platform for building hybrid applications and services.
                        <strong>Crown’s goal is to be one of the leading open platforms for applications and services which integrate
                        processes with the blockchain.</strong>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Importantly, we do not view Crown as the one platform to rule them all</strong> – this sort of vision of a
                        world with “one blockchain to rule them all” is contrary to the spirit and intent of an open society
                        and human freedom. In Tolkien’s telling of the story, the concentration of power in the “one ring”
                        was catnip for true evil. <strong>The technologies which Crown develops will be open source and will be
                        available to be copied by others.</strong>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>The only sustainable advantage Crown will have over time will be its community, and the ability of
                        that community to continuous improve and innovate.</strong>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We recognize that, in the immortal words of Sisyphus, “there goes the rock again….” The natural
                        state of things is for some people to want to boss other people around, and the struggle for human
                        freedom and agency is a Sisyphean task. But life is about the struggle, and nothing more.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If this perspective makes sense to you, the goal sounds interesting, and you know how to code feel
                        free to watch the project at github, and contact any of the team members to learn more.

                    <p>
                        At this point the uses for CRW are limited, and the market for CRW is small. If we are successful
                        in building the investor and developer community around CRW, the uses will grow.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The classic use of a token is for everyday commerce. CRW is intended to be an attractive medium for
                        everyday commerce because it will offer security, rapid confirmation, high network capacity and low
                        transaction costs. Consumers and merchants are invited to download the Android wallet and try it out.
                        You will be surprised how easy it is.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As services are developed on the platform – this will provide a base level of use, as the token is
                        used for technology services which operate at faster than human speed. We believe that the base
                        level of use from persistent software services running on the network will provide liquidity for the token, and also help drive continuous improvement in the platform.
