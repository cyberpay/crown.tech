                    he moved out from his old house and was around when Dogecoin launched, which is where he made his
                    first BTC. He then decided a few years later to come back just as scrypt asics hit the market,
                    which made him a nice profit. He also found out that the crypto space gave him new friends and new
                    types of coding abilties. He is responsible for the Crownpay mobile app, and is developing new
                    economy mobile applications for Crown.</p>

                <p>Crowncoin_Knight is a start-up investor and a co-founder of the Crown idea. His aim is to bring Crown
                    into the hands of everyday people. He is responsible for the strategy of the project and its direction.
                    His motto: most crypto project have no real story, Crown is one of the few exceptions: it connects the
                    history of the Crown to the blockchain.</p>

                <h4>Urban Idler</h4>
                <p>Urban Idler is a non-descript middle aged man with no distinguishing achievements or notable thoughts
                    during his inconsequential life, other than wondering where he left the book he was just reading.
                    In the course of reading one day he noticed that cryptography systems where bundling a variety of
                    different technological solutions into a unified protocol in a way that seemed to have the potential
                    to do a lot of new things. He became involved with the Crown project because the existing members of
                    the team were nice to him and asked good questions in a polite manner, and admitted to what they knew
                    and what they didn't know in a matter of fact way that made sense to him.  He watched to many episodes
                    of CHiPs as a child and believes Ready Player One is a work of incandescent genius.</p>
